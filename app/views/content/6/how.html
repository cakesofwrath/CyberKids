<p class="content">How are we going to do this? Don’t worry, it’s not difficult, we’ll tackle it step by step. First, let’s learn how to wait, so you can use this together with the hide/ show commands. </p>
<p class="content">The wait command is the first block under “Control”. Simply drag the block to the place in your code you want to have happen a little while after the block of code before it. This works, basically between any two blocks of code, when you want a pause between the two commands. Try it! </p>

<p class="content">Congrats! You know how to make your sprite wait before doing something. It’s about time it learned some patience. </p>
<p class="content">Okay, time to make your sprite appear and disappear! To do this, you’ll use the “Hide” and “Show” commands. These are found under the “Looks” Section in the Scripts toolbar. Now, just like you’ve done before, put hides in your code where you want your sprite to disappear, and shows where you want your sprite to appear. Where do you think you’d put the “Hide” or “Show” command if you wanted your sprite to start off screen? </p>
