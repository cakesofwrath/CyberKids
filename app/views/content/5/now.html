<p class="content">At this point, all the scripts you have made work like this: after the green flag is clicked, each block or instruction does whatever it’s supposed to, in order. If you tell your sprite to glide across the screen and then say “Hello!”, <b>your sprite will wait until it’s done moving to say “Hello!”, right</b>? But in this lesson, you learned about a block that works differently: the “Play Sound_____” block. Do you remember that the script <b>won’t wait for this block to finish before it goes to the other blocks?</b> Instead, it’ll start the sound and move on - this is different from every other block you’ve seen so far, and programmers have a scary, long name for it: <b>asynchronous</b> (or async). What does this mean? Basically, it means the opposite of what you’re used to, with the script waiting for blocks to finish before it moves on (this is known as <b>synchronous</b>). Instead, the action that each block is for (like moving, talking, playing sounds, etc.) starts, then the script moves on the next block <b>without waiting for the block to finish!</b> That’s async(hronous)!</p>
<p class="content">As you’ve seen, most of Scratch is synchronous, like you’re used to, so don’t worry if you don’t quite understand it. Besides this sound block, you probably won’t see it asynchronous blocks/programming very much in Scratch, but it is very impressive if you know it!</p>
<p class="content">Now, if you have extra time, try changing the volume by using the “Change Volume by ____” block. A negative number will lower the volume, and a positive number will raise it. If you finish this too, try adding multiple sounds and layering them on top of each other! See what happens, and most importantly, have fun!</p>
