<p class="content">There are several ways to add sounds. You can choose from the Scratch library, record your own sounds, or upload a sound from the internet. Like with the sprites, backgrounds, and costumes, we’ll focus on the sounds already in Scratch. Click on the first icon, and a window with all the sounds Scratch has will show up. If you want longer sounds (like background music), use sounds from the Music Loops section. Be sure to ask for headphones and check your volume before you play your sound!</p>

<p class="content">Great! Now you’ve added a new sound to your list. But now you need some way to play it! You can do this by adding Sound blocks to your script. Click on the label that says “Sounds”. Then, you have two options: either “Play Sound _____” or “Play Sound_____ until Done”. For “Play Sound”, it will start the music, then continue with the rest of your blocks in your script. For “Play Sound_____ until Done”, your script will wait for the music to finish. Choose which one you want, then drag it over to your script.</p>
