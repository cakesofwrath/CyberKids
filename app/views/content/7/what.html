<p class="content">﻿Let’s say you wanted to make a game like Flappy Bird or Mario, where a sprite keeps moving forward. Maybe you try to drag a bunch of blocks to make the sprite move. But that’s gonna end up being a really long script, right? In fact, it’s impossible for a game like Flappy Bird, where the game lasts until the player loses - so it’s impossible to know how many blocks. Wouldn’t it be great if you could repeat certain parts of your script instead? Today you’re going to learn how to use the “Repeat” block, which will let you run blocks within a loop, meaning they will run as many times as you want them to, or forever.</p>
