<p class="content">Click on “Control”, then drag the “Repeat 10 times” over to your code. Make sure all the code you want to be repeated is inside the “Repeat” loop. You’ll need this for the next lesson, so pay attention! </p>

<p class="content">Careful not to put your sound in the repeat loop, or the music will restart every time the loop restarts. If you want the music to repeat more than one time, you’ll have to make a separate segment of code by dragging another “Green Flag” command into your scripts, next to the one you already have. Then add another repeat loop, and put your sounds in it. You’ll have to use the “Play Until Done” command. </p>

<p class="content">By clicking on the number next to “Repeat”, you can change the number of times you want your code to repeat. </p>

<p class="content">Congrats! You now know how to make segments of code repeat, so your sprite can do the same thing over and over again, a certain amount of time, and, you now also know how to make a sound repeat a certain amount of times too! But what if you want to make your sprite move back and forth forever, or if you want to make a sound effect repeat forever? It’s easy: use the “Forever” command. </p>
