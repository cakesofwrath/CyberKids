<p class="content">﻿Now we’re going to first make the sprite (your character) move from one spot on your screen to another, then we’re going to make it glide from one location to another. The move command only shows your sprite in the original location, then again in the location you want it to. The glide command will show the sprite moving from the original location to the location you want it to move. </p>
