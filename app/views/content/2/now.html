<p class="content">If you finish with extra time left, you can change the values for x and y in “Go to x:0 y:0” by double clicking on it. You can also change both the x and y values for “Glide 1 sec to x:0 y:0” to make the sprite glide diagonally. Changing the number before “sec” changes the amount of time it takes for the sprite to glide from one location to the other. Have fun!</p>
