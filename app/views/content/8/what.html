<p class="content">﻿So you’re getting pretty far along in your programming. Congratulations! But, you’ve noticed something strange. Using the glide tool to move your sprites makes it look like their just gliding across the screen. So how do we make it look like they’re actually walking, and not floating like some sort of weird half human, half butterfly hybrid? Well, today, that’s what you’re going to do. A sprite, or a character, is actually just a picture. To make it look like the sprite is walking, or flapping its wings (if it flies), you’ll need two pictures, one for when the wings are up, another for when they are down, to make it look like the wings are moving. To do this, you’re going to need to change the sprite’s costumes, which generally different versions of the same image. Most sprites from Scratch have preset different looks, or costumes.</p>
