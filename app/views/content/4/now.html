<p class="content">Well, that’s way less boring now, huh? Here’s a little challenge for you: you might have noticed that you can have multiple sprites and backgrounds. Now that you know how to create a sprite and edit it, try to make another one and write a new script for it. How about backgrounds? It seems like you can’t have more than one background at a time, but maybe you can change the background from one to another. Might there be a block to do this? (hint: look under the “Looks” category of blocks.) When you feel good about how good your sprite and background looks (my bat is very swag, by the way), go on ahead to the next lesson.</p>
