<p class="content">﻿Remember when I asked if you were bored of the same cat and the same white background? It’s time to spice things up a little. As you know, in Scratch, you can make (almost) whatever you want, however you want. This time, we will show you how to change your character (your sprite), and how to change your background, to anything you want. <b>If you’ve already figured out how to change your sprite or background, you don’t have to go through this entire lesson - just read the bold parts, which are pretty important, and skip to the Now What? section.</b> If you haven’t changed your sprite/background yet, no problem. You’ll learn how to in this lesson.</p>
